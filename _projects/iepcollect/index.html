					<h4>Weekly Update #4</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>5/12/2015</strong><br />
					</p>
					<p>
						While we are not in the exact place we had set as our Milestone Two goal, we have made a similar amount of progress.
					</p>
					<p>
						We had meant to have data collection for a student completely implemented by now, and finished the digital mockup. We have finished mockup pages for all crucial actions in the app. Some secondary actions are not in the mockup, but they are not part of the tasks we are designing for.
					</p>
					<p>
						The hosted prototype app has many of our main screens and actions implemented but the full data colelction work flow is not done. We have completed the home screen, student profile, teacher login and account creation, accomodation viewing, and goal and track item creation. We have not implemented the interface for the task of daily tracking but the ability to collect and save the data exists under the hood.
					</p>
					<p>
						We have another usability testing meeting set up for this Wednesday and we are on track to reach our third milestone.
					</p>
					<p>
						This <a href="docs/milestone2.pdf" target="_blank">slide deck</a> contains more detail about our status.

							3 blocker:
							<ul>
								<li><span>need usability testing to progress after this digital mockup draft</span></li>
								<li><span>can only implement so much of app without confirmation that the design is right</span></li>
								<li><span>contacts with teachers have fizzled, need to reconnect</span></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						We spent the last week doing a lot of work on the design via the digital mockup and in beginning the implementation of our app. Design changes have been made due to feedback from usability testing and course staff. So far the app has all the nuts and bolts implemented, but none of the interface, tasks, navigation, or other specialized details.

					<h4>Weekly Update #2</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>4/29/2015</strong><br />
					</p>
					<p>
						After completing another interview and some mild usability testing with our rough digital mockup, our team is on track to meet our milestones as planned. Originally, we had expected to conduct some participatory design sessions by this milestone, however after last week's check in we decided to remove them from the plan. Scheduling a design session with multiple teachers at once was not feasible; all of our contacts are teachers at different schools in different parts of town with varied schedules. Also, since no one on our team has Android development experience we decided to switch platforms to build a web app instead of a mobile app. We will be using Ruby on Rails and hosting the app on Heroku. With these changes we are on track to meet our second and third milestones.

					<h4>Weekly Update #1</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>4/21/2015</strong><br />
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							3 done:
							<ul>
								<li><span>met with professor from College of Edu</span></li>
								<li><span>sent emails out to ~10 people about participatory design / future usability testing</span></li>
								<li><span>submitted application to EEU to interview a teacher</span></li>
								<li><span>met with teacher from cleveland high</span></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							3 will do:
							<ul>
								<li><span>find elementary teachers</span></li>
								<li><span>schedule and carry out participatory design sessions</span></li>
								<li><span>make a skeletal paper prototype or mockup</span></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							3 blocker:
							<ul>
								<li><span>waiting for email responses</span></li>
								<li><span>can't move too far in a mockup until participatory design sessions done</span></li>
								<li><span>need to talk with an elementary school teacher</span></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						In summary, we need to do more interviews with teachers, especially at the elementary level of education, in order to decide whether rescoping to a K-6 age group is the right choice to address the difference between age groups. In making a mockup we can at best estimate what choice we might make and then later likely have to change many things to fit with the answers we discover. We are in contact with lots of people, but to our knowledge not anyone who teaches at grade levels 1 though 5.

					<p>
						Our design is meant to be used via a tablet app, that can also be accessed using a browser interface for some tasks. For the purposes of time and the backgrounds of our team members, our high fidelity prototype is built as a Ruby on Rails app and hosted on Heroku.

					<h3>The Project</h2>
					<p>
						Our design is a tablet application for assisting daily data collection. General and special education teachers track information pretaining to the goals and accomodations specified by the students' IEPs. You can see previous research in this area, that we are building on, <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/iepconnect/">here</a>.
